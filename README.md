# Guidelines for submission of Proteomics data

## MIAPE (Minimum Information about a Proteomics Experiment)

> MIAPE guidelines describe the minimum information that should be included when reporting a proteomics experiment.
> The information must describe the experiment completely and allow potential recreation of the work.
> MIAPE guidelines do not:
> 1. make judgement on data quality, or
> 2. to fix data format for its representation, or
> 3. to establish how experiments are conducted.
